# log-output-helsinki-mooc
This is the repository for all of my exercises I developed during the DevOps with Kubernetes MOOC, by the University of Helsinki.

The docker image for the log-output is available on Docker Hub ("mayhewmatthew/log-output:latest"). I plan to include it on GitHub's Docker Registry in near future.
